INSTRUCTION TO EXECUTE THIS EXAMPLE

USING JDO ANNOTATIONS

1. Start MySQL (mysqld --console --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
2. Start MySQL Workbench
3. Create the database schema using the script in db folder
4. ant createschema 

(use the Workbench to check the generated schema; notice that the PK in "User" table is the login attribute,
as defined in the annotations).

5. ant run

USING THE PERSISTENCE METADATA XML FILE (package-my-not-in-use-sql.orm)

1. ant deleteschema
2. Rename the persistence metadata xml file to package-mysql.orm
3. Comment the annotations (at least the @PrimaryKey and @Join annotations, to illustrate the differences)
4. ant createschema

(use the Workbench to check the generated schema; notice that the PK in the "user" table is USER_ID, automatically
generated by Datanucleus, by default, as defined in the orm file)

5. ant run
